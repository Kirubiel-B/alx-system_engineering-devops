# Cloud Storage Service Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The outage occurred from February 20th, 2024, 3:00 PM UTC, to February 21st, 2024, 1:00 AM UTC.
- **Impact:** Our cloud storage service experienced complete downtime, rendering users unable to access their files. Approximately 70% of our users were affected by this outage.
- **Root Cause:** A runaway process on one of the storage servers consumed excessive system resources, leading to a cascade effect that brought down the entire service.

## Timeline

- **February 20th, 2024, 3:15 PM UTC:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server CPU usage.
- **February 20th, 2024, 3:20 PM UTC:** Engineering team notified and began investigating the cause of the elevated CPU usage.
- **February 20th, 2024, 3:30 PM UTC:** Initial assumption was a sudden increase in user activity. Logs analyzed for any unusual user behavior.
- **February 20th, 2024, 4:00 PM UTC:** Misleading investigation paths explored, including potential network congestion and database issues.
- **February 20th, 2024, 5:00 PM UTC:** Incident escalated to system administrators as server performance degradation persisted.
- **February 20th, 2024, 6:00 PM UTC:** Runaway process identified on one of the storage servers, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.
- **February 20th, 2024, 7:00 PM UTC:** Process terminated, but service restoration efforts hindered by cascading failures across other servers.
- **February 21st, 2024, 12:00 AM UTC:** System administrators implemented a temporary workaround to stabilize the service.
- **February 21st, 2024, 1:00 AM UTC:** Full service restoration achieved after deploying optimized resource allocation configurations.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** A runaway process on one of the storage servers monopolized system resources, causing performance degradation and triggering cascading failures across other servers in the cluster.
- **Resolution:** The runaway process was identified and terminated, and resource allocation configurations were optimized to prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, monitoring and alerting systems were enhanced to provide early detection of abnormal system behavior.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implementation of stricter resource utilization limits to prevent runaway processes from monopolizing system resources.
  - Regular audits of server configurations to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
  - Enhancements to monitoring and alerting systems to provide real-time notifications of abnormal system behavior.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Conduct a comprehensive review of server resource utilization limits and adjust as necessary to prevent future runaway process incidents.
  2. Implement automated monitoring and alerting for abnormal system behavior, such as sudden spikes in CPU or memory usage.
  3. Develop and document protocols for rapid incident response and escalation to minimize downtime during critical service disruptions.
  4. Schedule regular training sessions for the engineering and operations teams to ensure familiarity with incident response procedures and best practices.

By implementing these measures and addressing the outlined tasks, we aim to strengthen the resilience of our cloud storage service and minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future. Let's keep our data safely stored and our users smiling!
